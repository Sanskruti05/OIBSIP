                Modi as a Politician</h3>
            <p class="text-center justify-center" style="font-size: 22px;">
                In his early years, Modi worked as a volunteer for the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), a Hindu
                nationalist organization. He later became a full-time worker and rose through the ranks of the
                organization, serving in various positions.
                In 1987, Modi joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and was appointed as the General Secretary of the party's Gujarat unit. He was instrumental in organizing the party's campaign for the state assembly elections in 1990, which resulted in a victory for the BJP.
                In 2001, Modi was appointed as the Chief Minister of Gujarat, a position he held for four consecutive terms until 2014. As Chief Minister, Modi implemented several development projects in Gujarat and transformed the state into a business-friendly destination.
                In 2014, Modi led the BJP to a resounding victory in the general elections and was sworn in as the Prime Minister of India. During his tenure, he has focused on implementing various economic and social reforms, including the Make in India initiative, the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, and the Digital India campaign, among others.
                Modi's leadership style has been both praised and criticized. He is known for his strong communication skills and his ability to connect with the masses, but he has also been accused of being authoritarian and divisive. Despite this, Modi remains a popular leader in India, with a strong base of support among the country's Hindu nationalist and conservative communities.
