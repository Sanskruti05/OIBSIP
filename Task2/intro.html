                        <h3>Stock Price Prediction</h3>
                        <p>The project was based on the stock price prediction in which we first started with basic
                            central tendencies to predict the next value.Later on we moved towards the regression and performed linear and logistic regression. Om experimenting we found that the means squared error was less which means accuracy was good.</p>

                        <p>The project was website and application for the pets. In this we created a interface for the users where they can find their lost pets, or post if they found any pet.They can also contact for the help needed by the stray animals mostly when they are injured. The user can share the live location where the injured animal is found and the help will be sent to them. Same features for app also. </p>
